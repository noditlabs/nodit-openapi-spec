    Commitment:
      type: string
      description: |
        The commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time.
        - finalized - the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized
        - confirmed - the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
        - processed - the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.

      description: |
        Currently, the only valid value for this parameter is `0`. Setting it to `0` allows you to fetch all transactions, including both Versioned and legacy transactions.

        This parameter determines the maximum transaction version that will be returned in the response. If you request a transaction with a higher version than this value, an error will be returned. If you omit this parameter, only legacy transactions will be returnedâ€”any versioned transaction will result in an error.

              description: The last `numReadonlySignedAccounts` of the signed keys are read-only accounts.

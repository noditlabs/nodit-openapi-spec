        The commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time.
        - finalized - the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized
        - confirmed - the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.
        - processed - the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.

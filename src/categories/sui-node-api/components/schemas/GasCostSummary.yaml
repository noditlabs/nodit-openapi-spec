  Summary of the charges in a transaction. Storage is charged independently of computation. There are 3 parts to the storage charges:
  `storage_cost`: it is the charge of storage at the time the transaction is executed. The cost of storage is the number of bytes of the objects being mutated multiplied by a variable storage cost per byte
  `storage_rebate`: this is the amount a user gets back when manipulating an object. The `storage_rebate` is the `storage_cost` for an object minus fees.
  `non_refundable_storage_fee`: not all the value of the object storage cost is given back to user and there is a small fraction that is kept by the system. This value tracks that charge.

  When looking at a gas cost summary the amount charged to the user is `computation_cost + storage_cost - storage_rebate` and that is the amount that is deducted from the gas coins. `non_refundable_storage_fee` is collected from the objects being mutated/deleted and it is tracked by the system in storage funds.

  Objects deleted, including the older versions of objects mutated, have the storage field on the objects added up to a pool of "potential rebate". This rebate then is reduced by the "nonrefundable rate" such that: `potential_rebate(storage cost of deleted/mutated objects) = storage_rebate + non_refundable_storage_fee`

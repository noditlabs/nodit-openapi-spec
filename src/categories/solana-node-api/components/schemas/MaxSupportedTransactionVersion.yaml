  Currently, the only valid value for this parameter is `0`. Setting it to `0` allows you to fetch all transactions, including both Versioned and legacy transactions.

  This parameter determines the maximum transaction version that will be returned in the response. If you request a transaction with a higher version than this value, an error will be returned. If you omit this parameter, only legacy transactions will be returnedâ€”any versioned transaction will result in an error.

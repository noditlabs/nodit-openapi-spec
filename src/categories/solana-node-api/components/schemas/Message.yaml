  accountKeys:
    type: array
    description: List of base-58 encoded public keys used by the transaction, including by the instructions and for signatures. The first `message.header.numRequiredSignatures` public keys must sign the transaction.
    items:
      type: string
  header:
    type: object
    description: Details the account types and signatures required by the transaction.

    properties:
      numRequiredSignatures:
        type: integer
        description: The total number of signatures required to make the transaction valid. The signatures must match the first `numRequiredSignatures` of `message.accountKeys`.
      numReadonlySignedAccounts:
        type: integer
        description: The last `numReadonlySignedAccounts` of the signed keys are read-only accounts. Programs may process multiple transactions that load read-only accounts within a single PoH entry, but are not permitted to credit or debit lamports or modify account data. Transactions targeting the same read-write account are evaluated sequentially.
      numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts:
        type: integer
        description: The last `numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts` of the unsigned keys are read-only accounts.
  recentBlockhash:
    type: string
    description: A base-58 encoded hash of a recent block in the ledger used to prevent transaction duplication and to give transactions lifetimes.
